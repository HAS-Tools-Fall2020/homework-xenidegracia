### **Assignment questions**

**1. Include discussion of the quantitative analysis that lead to your prediction. This can include any analysis you complete but must include at least two histograms and some quantitative discussion of flow quantiles that helped you make your decision.**


**2. Describe the variable flow_data:**
- What is it?
  - It is a 'numpy.ndarray'.
- What type of values is it composed of?
  - The values  stored within "flow_data" are all floats.
- What is the dimension, and total size?
  - The dimension of flow_data is: 2
  - The total size of flow_data is: 46340. It means that it has 46340 elements.
  - The shape of the flow_data is: (11585, 4)


**3. How many times was the daily flow greater than your prediction in the month of September (express your answer in terms of the total number of times and as a percentage)?**

- Times that the flow was greater than my 1st week prediction = 89939

- Times in % that the daily flow was greater than my 1st week prediction =  %

- Times that the flow was greater than my 2nd week prediction = 916

- Times in % that the daily flow was greater than my 2nd week prediction =  %


**4. How would your answer to the previous question change if you considered only daily flows in or before 2000? Same question for the flows in or after the year 2010? (again report total number of times and percentage)**

- For the month of September and before 2000:

- Times that the flow was greater than my 1st week prediction Before year 2000 = 51294

- Times in % that the daily flow was greater than my 1st week prediction Before year 2000 = 1.140093280359302 %


- For the month of September and after 2010:

- Times that the flow was greater than my 1st week prediction After year 2010 = 15483

- Times in % that the daily flow was greater than my 1st week prediction After year 2010 =  %


**5. How does the daily flow generally change from the first half of September to the second?**

- The mean flow of the First Half of September is greater than the mean flow of the Second Half
