## Homework #3


### Weekly forecast
To forecast the 1st week, I used the average flow of the 3 weeks before that and for the 2nd week forecast, I used the average flow of the last week only.


### Seasonal Forecast
For the rest of the year, I used the average of 2019.


### Assignment questions
In addition to providing a summary of the forecast values you piked and why, include the following analysis in your homework submission.

1. Describe the variables flow, year, month, and day. What type of objects are they, what are they composed of, and how long are they?

All the variables: flow, year, month and day, are type list.
They have a lenght of: 11578


2. How many times was the daily flow greater than your prediction in the month of September (express your answer in terms of the total number of times and as a percentage)?

Times that the flow was greater than my 1st week prediction = 239
Times in % that the daily flow was greater than my 1st week prediction = 2.064259803074797 %
Times that the flow was greater than my 2nd week prediction = 916
Times in % that the daily flow was greater than my 2nd week prediction = 7.911556400069096 %


3. How would your answer to the previous question change if you considered only daily flows in or before 2000? Same question for the flows in or after the year 2010? (again report total number of times and percentage)

For the month of September and before 2000: 
Times that the flow was greater than my 1st week prediction Before year 2000 = 132
Times in % that the daily flow was greater than my 1st week prediction Before year 2000 = 1.140093280359302 %
Times that the flow was greater than my 2nd week prediction Before year 2000 = 360
Times in % that the daily flow was greater than my 2nd week prediction Before year 2000 = 3.109345310070824 %

For the month of September and after 2010: 
Times that the flow was greater than my 1st week prediction After year 2010 = 53
Times in % that the daily flow was greater than my 1st week prediction After year 2010 = 0.4577647262048713 %
Times that the flow was greater than my 2nd week prediction After year 2010 = 297
Times in % that the daily flow was greater than my 2nd week prediction After year 2010 = 2.56520988080843 %


4. How does the daily flow generally change from the first half of September to the second?

The mean flow of the First Half of September is greater than the mean flow of the Second Half
