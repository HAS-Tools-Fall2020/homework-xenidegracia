### This week's forecast
To forecast this week's flow I downloaded the data again from the USGS [mapper](https://maps.waterdata.usgs.gov/mapper/) and then I used the average flow of the 2019 year.


### Forecast for the rest of the year
Although, for the rest of the year, I used the average of the last 5 years, that is from 2015 to 2019.

I think it is important to know that for the last 2 weeks of the year, I didn't take into account the 2019 values, because they were too high compared to the rest of the years values for those 2 weeks.

I looked up a video of the river to see how it looks. Here is the link, just in case: [Verde River video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzXna_9EapQ)
