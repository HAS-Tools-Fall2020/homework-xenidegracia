>### **Instructions from Xenia :)**
*Hello dear evaluator! Here are the instructions to run my code in your own computer. Hopefully it will run well, but just in case, I want to apologize if it gives you any kind of problem and I will definitely owe you an ice cream for that.
Ok... Lets start!*
1. Clone my repo into your computer. I posted the link in here for your easy acces: [homework-xenidegracia](https://github.com/HAS-Tools-Fall2020/homework-xenidegracia)
2. Please download the data from: [USGS Station 09506000 VERDE RIVER](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/dv?referred_module=sw&site_no=09506000). Since January 1st, 1989, until today.
3. Save it as **".txt"** format, with the name: **"streamflow_week7.txt"**, in the **"data"** folder inside the repository: [homework-xenidegracia/data](https://github.com/HAS-Tools-Fall2020/homework-xenidegracia/tree/master/data).
4. Inside the code: Update the path of the data saved now in your computer to enable the code running. Line 28 of the code.
5. Run the code and get the 4 forecasting values.
6. Locate the **"Medina.CSV"** document, inside the forecasting repo. Here is the link: [forecasting/forecast_entries/](https://github.com/HAS-Tools-Fall2020/forecasting/blob/master/forecast_entries/medina.csv)
7. Please select the values that are printed in the **lines 208 and 215** of the code, as my entries in the CSV document of the forecasting repo.
8. Fill the information asked below this instructions on this markdown file.
9. To fill the *"Regression based Forecast"* section below, use the values obtained in the **lines 190 and 200** of the code.
10. Thank you so much for your suggestions and help with my coding skills.
11. Have a really nice weekend!
