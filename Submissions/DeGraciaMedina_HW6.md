>### **Weekly forecast**

*To forecast the 1st week, I used the average flow of the last 21 days and for the 2nd week forecast, I used the average flow of the last 14 days only.*

1. A summary of the AR model that you ended up building, including: 

- What you are using as your prediction variables.
  - My prediction variables are my flow data range from 1996 to 2004, because I saw that it was the most similar range data to continue predicting.
- The final equation for your model
  - My final equation for my model is: y = 57.19 + 0.76X
- What you used as your testing and training periods. In your discussion please include graphical outputs that support why you made the decisions you did with your model.

2. Provide an analysis of your final model performance. This should include at least one graph that shows the historical vs predicted streamflow and some discussion of qualitatively how you think your model is good or bad

3. Finally, provide discussion on what you actually used for your forecast. Did you use your AR model, why or why not? If not how did you generate your forecast this week?
